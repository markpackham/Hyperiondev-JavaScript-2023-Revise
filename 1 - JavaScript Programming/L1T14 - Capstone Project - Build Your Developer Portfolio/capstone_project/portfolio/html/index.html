            <h3>Objective</h3>
            <p>
                I aim to use the skills taught from bootcamps and my previous developer experience to become a senior
                developer. I desire to contribute to the maintenance and improvement of existing systems and assist in
                the
                training of junior devs.

            <h3>Work / Training</h3>
            <hr>
            <h5>2023 Sep-Dec</h5>
            <h5>Web Development Bootcamp – HyperionDev</h5>
            <p> A 3-month course teaching React, Express, MongoDB, CSS, and going in-depth with JS. I frequently
                submitted
                mini
                projects to create a portfolio and received feedback from experienced devs regarding industry standards
                and
                means to improve my skills.
            </p>

            <h5>2020 Mar-Jul</h5>
            <h5>Professional Software Development - CodeClan</h5>
            <p>
                A 16-week course with a minimum of 800 hours of coding creating projects in JS, React, Vue, Java,
                Spring,
                PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Docker, Sinatra, Ruby, Python, Flask, Django & CSS. Whilst the majority of the work
                was
                done either alone or via pair programming, I was also heavily involved in two group projects consisting
                of
                4-5
                people. The following was used for TTD - Mocha, JUnit, and MiniTest.
            </p>

            <h5>2018 Jun-Sep</h5>
            <h5> Developer – Maglabs
            </h5>
            <p> Supporting PHP/SQL based Asset Management systems running on Linux using the frameworks Agavi & Mojave.
                The
                majority of tasks were report generation via SQL and bug fixing.</p>


            <h5>2018 Apr-May</h5>
            <h5>Web Developer - Starbit</h5>
            <p>I'd make front-end changes based on Photoshop designs to Drupal-based sites as well as carry out bug
                fixes/security updates whilst documenting my progress via Gitlab.</p>

            <h5>2013-17 Dec-Jun</h5>
            <h5>Developer - Inviqa</h5>
            <p> I carried out bug fixing/security updates and feature/SEO enhancements on Drupal-based websites as part
                of
                Inviqa's support team. I'd build new sites shifting between back and front-end tasks. The job involved
                using
                PHP, CSS/SASS, Drush, Linux, SQL, JIRA and JS/jQuery. My job also entailed integrating social
                media/MailChimp
                into sites, review other devs' code, documentation, manual testing, archiving retired sites, spam
                removal,
                inserting the client's Google Analytics code and work estimates for clients. I assisted in the training
                of
                dev
                such as setting up local versions of the websites and pointing out the most frequent tasks and risks on
                the
                specific sites.</p>

            <p> I'd take charge of meetings/assigning Jira tickets to other devs and our support clients when the
                Account
                Manager was away. The tools I used to work were: PhpStorm, Tower, Compass, Kaleidoscope & GitHub. Sites
                were
                hosted on Acquia Cloud, platform.sh, Fasthosts and Pantheon.</p>
