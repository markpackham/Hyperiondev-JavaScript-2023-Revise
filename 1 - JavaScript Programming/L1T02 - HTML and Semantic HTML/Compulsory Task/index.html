                    the
                    work was done either alone or via pair programming, I was also heavily involved in two group
                    projects
                    consisting of 4-5 people. The following was used for TTD - Mocha, JUnit and MiniTest.</p>

                <p>Web Developer - Starbit
                    I'd make front end changes based on Photoshop designs to Drupal based sites as well as carry out bug
                    fixing/security updates whilst documenting my progress via Gitlab.</p>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h4>2013-17 Dec-Jun</h4>
                <p> Drupal Developer - Inviqa
                    I carried out bug fixing/security updates and feature/SEO enhancements on Drupal based websites as
                    part
                    of
                    Inviqa's support team. In a team of two to four devs I'd build new sites shifting between back and
                    front-end
                    tasks. The job involved using PHP, CSS/SASS, Drush, Linux in Ubuntu servers, SQL, JIRA, Confluence
                    and
                    JS/jQuery.
                </p>
                <p>My job also entailed integrating social media/MailChimp into sites, review other devs'
                    code,
                    documentation, manual testing, tidying up code repos, archiving retired sites, spam removal,
                    inserting
                    the
                    client's Google Analytics code and work estimates for clients. I assisted in the training of new
                    support
                    developers setting up local versions of the websites and pointing out the most frequent tasks and
                    risks
                    on
                    the specific sites.</p>
                <p> I'd take charge of meetings/assigning Jira tickets to other devs and our support clients when the
                    Account
                    Manager was away. The tools I used to work were: PhpStorm, Tower, Compass, Kaleidoscope & GitHub.
                    Most
                    sites
                    were hosted on Acquia Cloud, platform.sh and Pantheon.</p>
